## Movie API

### About
This is a simple api where I intend to practice many
"non code specific" related practices, such as the
following:

- Testing
- Caching
- API documentation with [SpringDoc](https://springdoc.org/)
- Linting with [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/) and [pmd](https://pmd.github.io/)
- CI/CD with GitHub actions

### How to build
Ensure you have docker installed on your machine, then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
